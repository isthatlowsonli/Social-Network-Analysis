## Getting Started

I use R for analysis. Please follow the instruction for executing the code.

### Prerequisites

Install [R](https://www.r-project.org) and [RStudio](https://rstudio.com)

### R Project Set Up

### Path 
Linked `nb.html` file is for demonstration. For executing the code, please go to the `Script` directory and find the `.Rmd` file with the same file name.)

## Reproducible environment

If you need to port your project to a new machine, you can call `renv::restore()` to reinstall all of the packages as declared in the lockfile.
